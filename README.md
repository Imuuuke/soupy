This is a basic ChatGPT Discord bot that utilizes the ChatGPT API.

As it is currently configured, it will respond to all @mentions of itself *and* to all messages in a specific channel, even if it isn't mentioned.

Set environment variables in .env, which currently includes:

1. Discord bot's token
2. OpenAI API Key
3. Bot's behaviour (attitude, preferences, etc)
4. The number of messages to consider during the bot's response.
5. A channel for the bot to respond in.

Error handling *may be* working currently.  It's hard to say.
